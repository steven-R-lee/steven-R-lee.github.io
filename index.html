  <H1>A Stale Pale Male needs to change to survive</H1>
  <H2>That means learning new tricks! Retraining and acquiring marketable skills</H2>
  <H3>The answer is .... a boot camp!</H3>

  <p>Starting in mid 2016 and finishing at the end of Septmeber 2016 the EDA course is offering me the opportunity to renew myself and to equip myself for the 21st jobs market.</p>

  <p>This is one of those life defining periods. The EDA Bootcamp for aspiring web developers offers people like me hope and another chance. I grasping it because as you get older the choices you make become more important. Why? Because TIME is ticking for us all.</p>
