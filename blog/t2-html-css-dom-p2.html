    <h2>designing that perfect webpage?</h2>
    <p>There are several fundamental components that profeesional web designers use to design an 'easy on the eye' website. These components include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>grid based design</li>
            <li>responsive webpages</li>
            <li>semantic structure</li>
        </ul>

      <h3> What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p><strong>Grid Based Design</strong> refers to the structural design layout of the webpage. The webpage layout is on a grid. <br/>
      The width of the webpage is divided across in columns, generally consisting of 12 columns: 1/12 (8.33%), 2/12(16.67%), ... , 12/12 (100%). Dividing the webpage into 12 columns allos the web developer to easily split the webpage into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 columns across, and by utilising the <em>span</em> provides control over positioning of content onto the webpage.

      <h3>what's all the hype about responsive web pages?</h3>
      <p><strong>Responsive Webpages</strong> improve user experience.<br/>
      Responsive webpages behaviour appropriately to the device of the user whether they a user a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile tablet device, or a mobile smartphone. Each of these devices will have different size screens with different screen resolutions. This ensures that the user will always be able to effectively view the content on the screen.<br/>
      This is acheived by the web developer working in percentages of screen-size resolution as opposed to fixed number of pixels.

      <h3>what is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p><strong>Semantic Structure</strong> provides the necessary structure in which to place the <em>Semantic Tags</em> onto the webpage.<br/>
      These semantic tags will include familiar HTML elements such as: p, h1, ..., h6, img, etc.
