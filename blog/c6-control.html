        <h3>what learning did you take from this chapter?</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          I was disappointed with this chapter and I believe that the youthfulness of the author limited his ability to consider the roles of maturity and wisdom in life. Of course, these are unfashionable virtues and thus, remain large absent from contemporary discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that I am one of the older students on the course and I am often left asking: "don't young people acquire these basic social skills these days/"
        </p>
        <p>
         I did nevertheless perserved with the chapter and discovered several useful <em>lessons</em>:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Daniel Goldman's 5 <strong>Emotional Competencies</strong> of: Self-Control, Trustworthiness, Conscientiousness, Adaptabilty and Innovation
            </li>
            <li>Seeing that you allways had a <strong>CHOICE</strong>if you temper your emotions
            </li>
            <li>Dealing with <strong>Triggers</strong> is nothing more than a labelling excuse utilised by people who can't deal with life's issues. Sorry folks, most of the peoples in previous generations managed to mature into sensible, reasoned and robust adults without be pampered. Sometimes ... we're disappointed with what people say and with certain outcomes in life. C'est La Vie!
          </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Emotional Competencies</strong> are important but perhaps they are best acquired through internalization and by learning from our repected elders.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also unsure about <strong>Innovation</strong> being regarded as an <em>Emotional Competence</em>. As a more mature adult, I can never recall a instance when possess the quality of an innovative mind has helped me overcome my bucking emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do agree that <strong>CHOICE</strong> is always an option for those who can maintain control over their emotions ... 'IF' ...

        <h3>how did you find the 2 minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I did 7 minutes of mindfulness. The <strong>sacred pause
          </strong> is magical and along with focusing on breathing, noticing, reflecting and responding it helped me release any disruptive emotion welling up inside of me, grounding me again in reality. The reality of happiness that I am enjoying this life.
