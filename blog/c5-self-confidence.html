      <div>
        <h3>what is the relationship between <em>'mindfulness'</em> and <em>'self awareness'</em> ?</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          When learning from experts such as Dan Goleman talking on <strong>Self Awareness</strong> and John Kabat-Zinn talking on <strong>Mindfulness</strong>, I recognise the relationship between the two practices as much the same thing: intertwined and hard to disentangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Self-awareness</em> is about the actor being aware of his emotions by maintaining neutrality, whilst remaining self-reflective. <br>
          <em>Mindfulness</em> is about the purposely paying attention to a particular moment without judgement.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>
          try at least one of the self-awarness practices fromthe chapter (Body, Journal)<br>
          what was your experience of it? how did you feel?
        </h3>
      </div>

        <p>
          I chose to do <strong>Journaling</strong> because I have practiced the technique for more than a decade.<br>
          Historically, I used the <em>journaling</em> technique when working in mny high-pressured environments as a contractor. I practiced it almost everyday while sitting on the train on the way home. Relaxing in <strong>stillness</strong> and then writing positive and negative activites that I had experienced throughout my day.<br>
          I also extended my journaling technique by reviewing wha I had written on that weekday in the previous week. It always surprised me to discover how things I felt would be challenges turned out not to be, and the converse.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience today ... similar to those of yester-year.<br>
          The relaxed, almost semi-conscious flow of words onto the page acts as a therapy. Whereby, issues through words on a page come out which I was seemingly never fully conscious of prior to the activity. E.g. my fear of writing code again after so many years away from the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was surpised by what I wrote. It was revealing, and gives me something to work-on aand to overcome.

        <h3>what did you take away from the <em>"My Emotions are Not Me"</em> section</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          My personal view is that the ideas expressed my the author are muddled and weak. It's as if you don't have appropriate control over your emotions then you can disown them. This is flakey philiosophy.
