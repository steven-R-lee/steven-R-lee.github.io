  <h1>Searching Inside Myself - Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>This blog reports on my thoughts on the concept of
    <strong><em> Medition Process</em></strong> on reading the second chapter in the book named <strong>Searching Indside Yourself</strong>.
    </p>  

  <h3>what did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
    <p>Prior to reading chapter 2 on <strong><em>Meditation</em></strong> 
    I held a deep understanding of what meditation was about from the alternative Christian approach to meditation, known as <strong>Christian Contemplation</strong>. This alternative method of the meditation process is similar but has its foundations within the western traditions of the Christian Faith <br/>

    Christian Contemplation is searching <em>pure prayer</em> ,or prayer of the heart. It's about being with God.<br/>

    However, I read the alternative apporach to the meditiation process told in chapter 2 with intrigue and interest.

  <h3>what new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
    <p>
    I learnt that there are many similarities between the Buddhist approach to Meditation ("being") and the Christian approach to Contemplation ("being with God").<br/>

    Certainly, the Buddhist way of meditation leads to enhanced levels of Emotional Intelligence through its activities of mental training - 
    <em>mindfulness meditation</em>.<br/>

    I also learnt that a person's default mental state is one of 'happiness', and that this is achieved through being in a state of mind which is simultaneously <em>calm</em> and <em>clear</em>.

  <h3>did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out for you?</h3>
    <p>
    In the Process Model of Mindfulness Meditation: #1 Attention, #2 Cognitive Process, #3 Attitude, #4 Intention, it's #2 that stands out for me. The humans qualities of ruminating, worrying and fantasizing in our lives are frequent and everyday occurences that happen within our heads. These occurences can often distract us from the task in the moment. Therefore, the fact that by practising the meditation process makes us aware of these distractive qualities should allow us to cope better and to concentrate harder and for longer periods.<br/>

    I also found that the approach to the meditation process proposed by the Author emphasizes short meditation periods. This is very different from that found in the tradition of Christian Contemplation, which is a practice that may demand long periods: hours, days or weeks: in meditation practice.<br/>
    </p>

   <h3>any other musings?</h3>
    <p>
    The chapter sets out a useful approach to meditation and for acheiving a mental-state of both clear and calm. However, there are alternatives, such as that of Christian Contemplation.
