    <h1>Designing a Blog</h1>
      <p>
        This week I got stsarted on the task on designing websites,<br/>
        and implementing those designs.

    <div>
      <h3>what is a responsive site?</h3>
        <p>
        A <strong>Resposive Site</strong> is one that responds to the screen<br/>
        size of the viewing device, a smartphone, a phablet, a laptop or a desktop<br/>
        computer. On a technical note this metric is determined by the number of pixels<br/>
        that the screen is made up of.
        </p>
        <h3>And why is responsiveness important?</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Resposiveness</strong> is important because it impacts on users'<br/>
        experiences, (UX). It adapts the websites features to ensure the users experiences<br/>
        are more likely to be positive, i.e., being able to view all the essential features<br/>
        on the page, catering for speedy downloads, etc.<br/>
        If the user isn't impressed, they most likely won't return to your website.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h3>what is mobile first design?</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Mobile First</strong> is when the web designer considers small mobile<br/>
        mobile devices first during the process of designing a website.<br/>
        </p>
        <h3>why is "mobile first" important?</h3>
        <p><strong>Mobile First</strong> is important because it helps determine the baseline<br/>
        experience for users of a website.<br/>
        Small mobile devices aren't as powerful as desktop computers, generally, and the situation<br/>
        is changing. Dealing with the technical requirements of small mobile devices first<br/>
        ensures a minimization of frustration levels of such users, while allowing space enhancements<br/>
        for users of more powerful devices.
        </p>
    </div>   

    <div>
      <h3>what are frameworks?</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Frameworks</strong> are packaged kits - processes and tools.<br/>
        These allows web developers to rapidly implement websites.
        </p>
        <h3>what are the pros and cons of frameworks?</h3>
        <strong>Pros:</strong>
          <ul>
          <li>allow for rapid website building, using templates </li>
          <li>allow for consistency and easy for beginners</li>
          </ul>
        <strong>Cons:</strong>
          <ul>
          <li>use of templates limits flexibility </li>
          <li>lack of scope for the web developer to attain unique style</li>
          </ul>
    </div>  
    
    <div>
      <h3>what is a wireframe?</h3>
        <p>
        A <strong>Wireframe</strong> is a systematic method of laying out initial<br/>
        webpages designs on a grid, and using boxification.<br/>
        The grid is typically 12-by-12 in size.
        </p>
        <h3>why we use a wireframe?</h3>
        <p>
        It simplifies the process of translating design from ideas to screen.
