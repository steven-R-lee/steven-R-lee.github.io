        how does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the 3 fundamental programmiing languages used in constructing today's modern web-pages and web-apps.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong> acts as placeholders for content on web-pages.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong> provides the mechanism for styling the look and feel of web-pages.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> provides the means for bringing dynamism to web-pages.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> when used in combination can produce <em>static</em> web-pages, just like the pages you'd see in a book.
        </p>
        <p>
          By adding <strong>JavaScript</strong> can produce interactivity between web-users (clients) and web-producers (servers). In doing so, <em>static</em> web-pages are transformed into <em>interactive</em> web-apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          This <em>interactivity</em> comes at a price: JavaScript.<br>
          Transforming static web-pages into inteactive web-apps demands a more sophisticated and robust programming language than HTML and CSS. Utilisation od JavaScript allows web-developers to produce web-apps that support the delivery of both dellivering and receiving communicationsover the internet:a dialogue as opposed toa monologue.

      <div>
        <h3>
          explain control flows and loops using an example process from everyday life,<br>
          for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing you teeth'.
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Control Flows</strong> are classically represented in JavaScript by <em>if</em>, <em>if/else</em>, <em>if/else if/ else</em> and <em>switch: case/break/default</em> commands. These are analogous to choice-making procedures in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are required to make decisions in your everyday life based on the options you have in front of you and on your desired outcome.<br>
          For Example: IF the bus is due to arrie within 15 minutes I wait for it and catch the bus home ELSE I will walk home.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Loops</strong> are classically represented in JavaScript by <em>for</em>, <em>while</em>, <em>do while</em> commands. These are analogous to repeating procedures in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are required to repeat actions in your everyday life based until a certain desired condition is satisfied.<br>
          For Example: If an exam consists of 100 questions each worth one mark and you need to attain a score of 70% to pass the exam then:<br>
          WHILE you have not answered 70 of the 100 exam questions correctly, keep attempting to answer questions correctly.
        </p>
      </div>    

      <div>
        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          You might access the data within your data containers through two ways using JavaScript: <strong>From Arrays</strong> or thorugh <strong>Object Literals</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: objectName{"propertyName"} --- accessing through <em>From Arrays</em> means.<br>
          For example: objectName.propertyName --- accessing through <em>Object Literals</em> means.<br>
          These commands provide equivalent results.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>explain what fucntions are, and why they are useful</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, <strong>Functions</strong> allows you to group a series of commands together in order to perform a specific task. If different parts ofthe JavaScript code repeat the same task over and over again, you can re-use the function (rather than repeating the same set of instructions).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: In everyday life you might brush your teeth after everytime you eat. Such a <em>function</em> required you to commit a series of actions: go to bathroom, find tooth brush and find toothpaste, open tooth paste tube, apply toothpaste to toothbrush, brush teeth, etc. You commit that series of actions to your memory in the form of a stored <em>function</em>. And instead of listing out all the actions required for cleaning your teeth each time you might just recall the <em>function</em>: 'CLEAN TEETH'.
