        <h3>1. when I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h5>what was the problem?</h5>
        <p>
          I wanted to delete a folder with several files in it, on my computer.
          However, I was new to the computer's operating system and I wasn't confident about issuing the correct commands to my computer in order to delete the unwanted folder and the files sitting within it.
        </p>
      <h5>what was the problem solving techniques did i use?</h5>
        <p>
          I used 3 problem sovling techniques to solve the problem:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>Tried Something:</strong> explored if there was a simple command which I could apply to delete the unwanted file - NO!
            </li>            
            <li>
            <strong>Googled the Problem:</strong> conducted an internet search to discover if anyone else had come across the same problem and resolved it - YES!
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Asked a Coach for help:</strong> asked a coach for advice and confirmation to use the "rm -rf" command line in order to avoid doing something that might have caused further issues - ADVICE TAKEN and PROBLEM SOLVED!
            </li>         
          </ol>
      <h5>how did I feel throughout the process?</h5>
        <p>
          I felt apprehensive at trying something new, but not fearful to the state where I froze. I always knew my problem had a straight-forward solution and that I merely required some re-assurance.
        </p>
      <h5>what did I learn?</h5>
        <p>
          The coaches at EDA have seen the overwhelming majority of problems before, and can offer the guidance and advice for me to ultimately solve my own problems.
        </p>

        <h3>2. solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h5>what was the problem?</h5>
        <p>
          At one point in my career people wanted to engage my serivces as a damn good Data Analytics Specialist ... many moons ago.<br>
          I had too much work-on and it would have been impossible for me to deliver all the work that was being demanded of me without disappointing one or two clients.
        </p>
      <h5>what was the problem solving techniques did i use?</h5>
        <p>
          Ask for help ...
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            I endeavoured to re-negotiate the deadlines with my clients - WITHOUT SUCCESS!
            </li>            
            <li>
            I asked some fellow self-employed Data Analysts/Statisticians for help, and they had spare capacity and they were able to assist me with the task of delivering on time. WITH SUCCESS! 
            </li>      
          </ol>
      <h5>how did I feel throughout the process?</h5>
        <p>
          I was concerned, losing work opportunities though losing potential clients was constantly on my mind as a self-employed person. But, I trusted in my fellows and friends around me, (and the clients for accepting a substitue for me).
        </p>
      <h5>what did I learn?</h5>
        <p>
          That once again the greatest source of assistance is there in front of me: fellows and friends.
        </p>

      <h3>
        REFLECT<br>
        on how confident you feel on using the problam solving techniques and processes  
      </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I love this technique and it is often the first one I reach for when faced with a really challenging problem. It gives direction and clarity to problem solving. It provides a skeleton and placeholders to place the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Trying Something:</strong> I also love this technique. I've found that it is usually pretty inmprobable, especially as a beginner, to mess a task completely up. And that having a go, and trying somethings - different approaches - usually leads to furher learning opportunities and eventually deeper understanding of the task that was causing the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rubber Duck Method:</strong> Nope! This method to solving problem doesn't work that effectively for me, largely because there is no feedback-loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong> The Error Messages often thrown-up by the computer can be somewhat cryptic, but they can often offer a good starting point for solving a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Console Logging:</strong> I find this technique useful as it makes visible the invisible of what is going on behind the scenes. Again, they can offer a good starting point for solving a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Googling:</strong> Undoubtedly a quick and powerful techinique, but I find it can offer only superficial offering to the learning process. I need to hear it from the human voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asking Your Peers For Help:</strong> I'm never shy to ask for help. Questions aways offer the Questioner the best opportunity to learn. They can also help cement the knowledge of the Respondent. A kind of mutual benefit for both parties
        </p> 
        <p>
          <strong>Asking Coaches For Help:</strong> Ditto.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Improving Your Process With Reflection:</strong> I subscribe to <em>Journaling</em> which makes me reflect on my learning experiences. I have found <em>reflection</em> prepares me for future challenges.
        </p>

      <h3>
        describe what these JavaScript functions do in your own words:  
      </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The JavaScript Array object is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects...<br>like a container in which you might drop everyday objects of similar or differing kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>.map()</strong> map() calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in order, and constructs a new array from the results ... it kinds of acts like a telephony service, picking out each of the everyday objects from the container one by one and placing them in turn into a new container.
        <p>
          <strong>.filter()</strong> filter() calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array of all the values for which callback returns a value that coerces to true ... it assists the map() function in its job of creating a new container through application of a rule-based filtering system: either accepting or rejecting the everyday objects to be placed in the new container,.
        </p>        
        <p>
          <strong>.reduce()</strong> reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value ... if your everyday item is complex then the description of your everyday item will be reduce to a simple singular descriptive.
        </p>
