          from the 'discovering values and higher purpose exercise'<br>
          what are your core values?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
         How do I answer this question being truly honest? I don't want to resort to a set of cliche words, so you mightn't like what you see on my list, below.
        </p>
        <p>
        So here is my list of which I am willing to discuss with you:
          <ul>
            <li>individualism rules over corporatism</li>
            <li>solidute rules over togetherness</li>
            <li>perception rules over judgement</li>
            <li>feeling rules over analysis</li>
            <li>meritocracy rules over equality</li>
            <li>justice rules over fairness</li>
          </ul>
          To remember <strong>Hope</strong>, <strong>Faith</strong> and 
          <strong>Love</strong> of which LOVE reigns supreme.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>
          from the 'discovering values and higher purpose exercise'<br>
          what do you stand for?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
        I try to stand for:
          <ul>
            <li>strength</li>
            <li>courage</li>
            <li>inquisitiveness</li>
            <li>creativeness</li>
            <li>calmness</li>
            <li>selflessness</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>
          how did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercises?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The resilience were hard for me. I believe that resilience may be developed in many different ways and on many different levels - individual, family and community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly <em>inner calm</em> and an increase personal <em>emotional intelligence</em> enhances resilience. Through contemplation and daily prayer I believe that I am enhancing my resilience. My resilience often being tested along with my faith.

      <div>
        <h3>
          any other musings?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          On reflection, I felt Chapter 6 centred on beliefs and resilience more  than the advertised motivation, but perhaps I'm wrong.
