    <h1>The JavaScript Language</h1>
    </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          I'm a complete novice when it comes to JavaScript and I'm at the stage where I'm still frequently being tripped over by the idiosyncracies of this computing language. Over time I am certain that I will become more familiar with its grammar, syntax and volcabulary of keywords.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>in the JavaScript language,<br>
        describe all the use cases for ...</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h5>parentheses ()</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Parentheses</strong> are written as () in JavaScript.<br>
          They have three major uses in JavaScript with:
        </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Function Calls</li>
              <li>Conditional Statements</li>
              <li>Order of Operations</li>
            </ol>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, <strong>Function Calls</strong> are used to call a <em>function</em> which is a block of computer code again and again from inside a programme. The function with its accompanying () perenthese will be assigned a name by the coder who will then be able to call it from anywhere with the programme. The () parentheses may sometimes be empty but often they'll contain arguments - values that will be feed into the function.
          </p>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, <strong>Conditional Statements</strong> are used to control the flow of a programme. These consists of "if", "elseif" and "else" statements. The condition componet of these commands will be contained within the () parentheses.
          </p>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, <strong>Order of Operations</strong> that's mathematically operations can be overridden by the applications of () parentheses. i.e. ((1+2)*3) is not equivalent to (1+2*3).
          </p>
        </div>

      <div>
      <h5>bracket []</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Brackets</strong> are written as [] in JavaScript.<br>
          The primary use of [] brackets in JavaScript is for access data objects. Data objects can be thought of as containers with data inside of them. These are typically in the form of lists or arrays in the common parlence.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Given an array of var myArray = [1,3,5,7,9], the forth number in the list can be accessed through myArray[3], remembering the first number, (or element) in the array has an index of [0].
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h5>braces{}</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Braces</strong> are written as {} in JavaScript.<br>
          The two principle uses of {} braces in JavaScript are for containing object literals at the point of their declaration and to act as benign placeholders for blocks of code to make the code more readable.  
        </p>
      </div>     

      <div>
      <h5>single quotes '' and double quotes ""</h5>
        <p>
          There are no hard and set rules around the use of <strong>single quotes '' and double quotes ""</strong> in JavaScript.<br>
          THowever, it is important to be your consistent with them when coding in JavaScript, just as you would be when writing in English.
