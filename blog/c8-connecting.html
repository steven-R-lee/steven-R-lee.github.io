          have you ever tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?<br>
          how did it go?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
         When I was young man, 30 plus years ago, we called this good breeding and manners. The building of trust and sincerity came through the customs and traditions of society and acting them out through conventional socialisation processes. In those times, people didn't obsess about building trust and sincerity as they were too busy living their lives and letting such matters take their natural course. You can't even hope to build enduring trust or sincerity in an artifical manner. The stuff we see so much of in the world today is nothing more than superficial decoration that covers festering misery.
        </p>
        <p>
       Marc Lesser states five techniques for building trust and sincerity within a group:
          <ol>
            <li>establish trust</li>
            <li>listen (by "looping" and "dipping")</li>
            <li>asking probing and open-ended questions</li>
            <li>provide feedback</li>
            <li>partnering to create options and practices</li>       
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
         This is where my personal life experiences come in to play, including managing diverse groups of people within workplaces. I'd say there are several features to organically growing trust and sincereity within you team, and these are:
          <ol>
            <li>values: shared customs and traditions</li>
            <li>goals: shared existential purpose, i.e. earning a good living</li>
            <li>respect: for traditions and history</li>
            <li>courage: for taking risks and trying out new ideas</li>
            <li>likability: people in a team have to gel which means liking each other</li>          
          </ol>

          tried empathy listening - how did it go?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Empathy listening for me is just plain listening. I'd consider it rude pretend to listen to people without putting yourself into their shoes when they are voicing their views and concerns, thoughts and feelings. It's how relationships, built on trust and sincerity endure overs years and decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard the exercise, I would suggest that the meta-conversation is a tad obsessive.

          how did you find the loving and kindess meditation?
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          I found this a good exercise and again it is something that I have endeavoured to practice thoughout my life, hitherto. <br/>
          Yesterday, I prayed for my wife's happiness with a job interview she attended. I also prayed for happiness for the interviewers. It was a happy interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frequently pray for happiness and understanding prior to making big choices, and for others who are also faced with making a big choices.

          This book really does try teach grandmother to suck eggs at times! But maybe that's because I'm older than most of the people on the course. I grew up in a different era.
