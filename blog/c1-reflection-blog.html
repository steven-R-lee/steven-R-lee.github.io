  <h1>Life at EDA: Trainee Web Developer</h1>
  <h2>Fireside Chat with Shereef</h2>

  <p>I've just watched a video mad by Shereef who is a Web Developer Bootcamp teacher in USA. He put it on the line as the what I might expect during and after my camp at EDA in Wellington.</p>

  <h3>what's my take on the EDA experience?</h3>
  <p>After only a few days I already have a good feel for EDA and that's warm and friendly. The EDA tutors are constant putting 100% effort into their job; teaching me and other students.  Mind you they are more like guides an teachers. And that's good.</p>
  
  <h3>what are my impression?</h3>
  <p>It's intense from the get-go. I was initially caught in the the glare of oncoming headlights ... but ... I took a deep breath and dived into the work. How could I possibly break GitHub or a Command Line? And when I realised that I was doing heaps of this back over two decades ago on old remote UNIX machines, I thought to myself that I should stop worrying and just get on with it. To my delight I have found my fellow students and tutor very reassuring and comforting. It's a good environemnt to jump in and learn it. </p>

  <h3>How do I see myself engaging with this culture?</h3>
  <p>I'm an introvert but I love learning. I always have loved learning. I also see EDA as a place where I can explore my options without guilt, or too many restraints. Will I use my newly developed skills in the World of Data Analytics and Statistics that is oh-so familiar to me? Or will I go off and explore the front-end of the web or jump onto functional programming?  Choices, choices, choices.</p>

  <h3>Have my expectations of EDA changed?</h3>
  <p>No. I just had a gut feeling that it would be goos for me. And it will be as I am determined to make it work for me. I'm running my own race. I' here tobe creative and I'm definitely not a consumer of we dev.</p>
  
  <h3>Am I excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</h3>
  <p>You betcha. I have had a rather unstimulating time over the past few years. And I believe that when EDA open their doors to me, they weren't just offering me a web dev. course, but offering me a new opportunity for a better life.</p>

  <h3>How do I see myself engaging with this culture?</h3>
  <p>I'm not nervous ... I'm excited by all the possibilies which are sure to open up for me from today.</p>
