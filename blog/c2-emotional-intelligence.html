  <h1>Searching Inside Myself - Chapter 1</h1>
  <p>This blog reports on my thoughts on the concept of <strong><em>Emotional Intelligence</em></strong> on reading the first chapter in the book named <strong>Searching Indside Yourself</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>which learnings did you take fro this chapter?</h3>
  <p>I had already read and studied many of Daniel Goleman's works on Emotional Intelligence prior to undertaking any of this week's reading. It's a nice little introductory book that sets out the arts of enhancing your Emotional Intelligence (EI) through training your attention and mindfulness. <br/>
  For beginners who seek a way for enhancing their EI it offers many helpful and simple tips that may lead to the person feeling somewhat happier about their life and the workplace in which they spend much of their time. I would encourage anyone to try it.<br/>
  Personally, I have my own tried and proven ways of meditating and being mindful, with over 2000 years of history to support it. Each morning and evening I spend around 15 minutes on my own locked in prayer. It definitely calms me and puts my life into perspective for me.
   </p>

  <h3>how did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
  <p>It's always good to escape into the moment of <strong>now</strong>. I don't really have anymore to add but to say to others try the two minutes breathing awareness routine. You'll feel better for it.</p>
