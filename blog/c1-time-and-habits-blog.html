  <H1>Managing Resources: Time and Habit</H1>
  <p>It's be clear and say that only a fool would not want to manage their time better, and be more productive as a consquence.</p>

  <H3>which timebox and habit techniques did I try?</H3>
  <p>I am not new to this game and I have tried several many ways to manage my time and increase my prodcutivity over the years. However, I'm always open to novel ideas, well novel to me that is, such as the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

  <H3>what did I find interesting?</H3>
  <p>That would be the seven counterintuitive ways to be insanely productivity. I have always found that wanting to achieve an objective too much just doesn't work for me. And besides, flow over structure can lead a person anywhere.</p>

  <H3>what worked for me?</H3>
  <p>Prayer ... Agility and Flow ... Personal Kanban ... a walk in the woods. In that order. Works for me.</p>

  <H3>which will I experiment with further?</H3>
  <p>I'll be giving the Pomodoro Technique ago. I hope it will assist me in going down to many rabbit-holes.</p>
